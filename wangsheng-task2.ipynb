    "# Task 2: Recommendation Engine - Skeleton Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a very basic example for the notebook you are expected to submit for Task 2 of the Final Project. The main purpose is that we can try different examples to get a better sense of your approach. Compared to Task 1 (Kaggle Competition), we don't have any objective means to evaluate the recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some general comments:\n",
    "* You can import any data you need. This particularly includes your cleaned version of the properties dataset (incl. the auxiliary data or any other data you might have collected); there's no need to show the data cleaning / preprocessing steps in this notebook.\n",
    "* You can also import your code in form of external Python (.py) script. You're actually encouraged to do so to keep this notebook light and uncluttered.\n",
    "* **Important:** Please consider this notebook as an example and not to set specific requirements. Your notebook is likely to look very different. As long there is a section where we can easily test your solution, it should be fine."
